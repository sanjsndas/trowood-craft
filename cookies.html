                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies allow websites to recognize users and remember their preferences, such as login details, shopping cart contents, and other personalized settings.</p>
                    <p>At TrowoodCraft, we use cookies to enhance your browsing experience and provide you with personalized services. Without cookies, many website features wouldn't function properly, and your experience would be less seamless and efficient.</p>

                    <h3>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                    <p>We use several types of cookies on our website, each serving different purposes. Essential cookies are necessary for the website to function properly and cannot be switched off. Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our site by collecting anonymous information.</p>
                    <p>Functional cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. Targeting cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests. We also use session cookies that are temporary and deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies that remain until they expire or you delete them.</p>

                    <p>Essential cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our website. These cookies enable you to navigate the site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.</p>
                    <p>For example, we use essential cookies to remember items you add to your shopping cart during a browsing session, to identify you as being logged in to the TrowoodCraft website, and to ensure you connect to the right service on our website when we make any changes to how it works.</p>

These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor - all information is aggregated and therefore anonymous.</p>
                    <p>We use this data to understand how our website is performing and where we can make improvements to enhance your experience. For instance, performance cookies might show us which pages are most frequently visited, helping us identify popular content and improve less-visited pages.</p>

                    <p>Functionality cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language preference, or the region you're in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, fonts, and other customizable elements of web pages.</p>
                    <p>For example, a functionality cookie may be used to remember your preferred currency for product pricing, or to remember that you've already completed a survey so it doesn't ask you to complete it again during your visit.

                    <p>Targeting cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

                    <p>First-party cookies are set by our website directly and can only be read by our site. These are typically used for functionality like remembering your login status or shopping cart contents. Third-party cookies are set by domains other than our website, typically by our partners and service providers.</p>
                    <p>For example, we might use third-party cookies from analytics services like Google Analytics to understand how our site is being used, or from social media platforms to enable social sharing features. While we carefully select our third-party providers, we don't have direct control over their cookies, so we recommend reviewing their privacy policies as well.</p>

                    <h3>8. Session vs Persistent Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave our website. These are essential for proper website functionality, such as keeping you logged in as you navigate between pages. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period specified in the cookie or until you manually delete them.</p>
                    <p>At TrowoodCraft, we use session cookies for critical functions like maintaining your shopping cart during a browsing session. Persistent cookies might be used to remember your language preference or login information (if you choose "Remember me") so you don't have to enter them every time you visit. The lifespan of our persistent cookies varies from a few days to several years depending on their purpose.</p>

                    <h3>9. How We Use Cookies for Analytics</h3>
                    <p>We use analytics cookies to collect information about how visitors use our website, which helps us improve it. These cookies gather data such as the number of visitors, where visitors come from, and the pages they visit. This information is aggregated and therefore anonymous.</p>
                    <p>For example, analytics might show us that most users abandon their shopping cart at the shipping options page, indicating we might need to simplify our shipping process. We use this data to make informed decisions about website improvements without identifying individual users.</p>

                    <h3>10. Cookies for Personalization</h3>
                    <p>Personalization cookies help us tailor our website to your preferences and provide you with a more personalized experience. These cookies may remember your location to show you locally relevant content, or remember your preferred currency for displaying prices.</p>
                    <p>At TrowoodCraft, we might use these cookies to show you products similar to ones you've viewed before, or to remember your preferred wood type when browsing our collections. This personalization enhances your experience by making our website more relevant and convenient for you.</p>

                    <h3>11. Social Media Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We integrate social media features into our website that may set cookies on your device. These cookies allow you to share content from our site on social networks or log in using your social media credentials. The social media networks may use these cookies for their own purposes.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you use the Facebook "Like" button on our product pages, Facebook may set a cookie to remember that you've liked the product. These cookies are outside our control, and we recommend reviewing the respective social media platforms' cookie policies for more information.</p>

                    <h3>12. Cookie Lifespan</h3>
                    <p>The lifespan of a cookie depends on its purpose. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies have varying lifespans ranging from a few minutes to several years. We carefully consider the appropriate duration for each cookie based on its function.</p>
                    <p>For security reasons, our authentication cookies might last only for your browsing session. Preference cookies might last longer (e.g., 1 year) so you don't have to reset your preferences each visit. Analytics cookies typically have shorter durations (e.g., 30 days) to ensure we're working with recent data.</p>

                    <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish through your browser settings. You can delete all cookies already on your device and set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. However, if you do this, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our site and some services and functionalities may not work.</p>
                    <p>Most browsers allow you to manage cookie preferences through their settings. Typically, you can find these controls under "Options" or "Preferences" in your browser menu. For more detailed guidance, consult your browser's help documentation or visit aboutcookies.org which provides instructions for managing cookies in various browsers.</p>

Essential functions like adding items to your shopping cart or logging into your account may not work. The website may not remember your preferences, requiring you to reset them each visit.</p>

For non-essential cookies (like analytics and advertising cookies), we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing.

These include analytics services (like Google Analytics), advertising networks, social media platforms, and payment processors. Each of these services has its own privacy and cookie policies.</p>
                    <p>While we carefully select our third-party providers, we don't have direct control over their cookies. We provide links to their policies where possible and recommend reviewing them if you have concerns.

                    <p>We take the security of all data collected through cookies seriously. Our website uses HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit. Cookies that contain sensitive information (like authentication tokens) are encrypted and have security flags set to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
                    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect cookie data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Regular security audits help us maintain the integrity of our systems. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                    <p>Some of our third-party cookie providers may process data outside your country of residence. When this occurs, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you're in the European Economic Area (EEA) and we transfer your data to a service provider in the United States, we'll ensure the provider participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or has implemented other approved transfer mechanisms. You can contact us for more information about specific international transfers.</p>
